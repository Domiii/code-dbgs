Dbux is an integrated debugging environment (IDbE) and omniscient debugger for JavaScript dynamic analysis. We hope to help developers (i) improve program comprehension and (ii) increase debugging efficiency. To that end, Dbux records an application's runtime data, visualizes it and makes it interactive.

# Video Introduction

To get a good first impression of Dbux, we recommend this video. It...:

* → explains why we need better Debuggers,
* → demonstrates all of Dbux's tools with plenty of examples,
* → is fully timestamped (if you are impatient, we recommend taking a quick glimpse by skipping around a bunch).
