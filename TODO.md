## TODO
* add "Dbux: Run Current File" command to dbux-code
* code: resilience
   * dbux-projects
      * need a button or command to fully clear the `projectsRoot`
   * system integrity check upon first run
      * bash (all shell execution must work)
      * node
      * npm
      * git
   * handle version updates correctly
      * -> make sure, we install correct dependencies (especially @dbux/cli) version
      * automatically delete project folder on version update?
         * add user warning (allow user to cancel, which will cancel the whole run)
* merge PR
* core instrumentation bugs
   * trace function parameters
   * fix: call traces for getters are off
      * it's actually the next trace in context (if the getter did not error out)
      * e.g.: `req.protocol` (instead of `req`)
   * when encountering getter inside of a `CallExpression`, it will be mixed in with call, since it does not have its own BCE
   * identify + visualize getters and setters with an "f"?
      * just any context's parentTrace that is not stemming from a call?
* add `eslint` into build pipeline
* move process-related stuff from `dbux-projects` to `dbux-cli`
* Deployment
   * `Process.exec` can use some polishing. Properly pipe stdout + stderr.
* allow setting application name via babel config
   * also allow setting that application name via `dbux-cli`
   * set application name for `dbux-projects` bugs correspondingly
* [dbux-projects]
   * allow user to change mocha/jest run timeout (in case of slow computers)
      * -> or just set it very high?
      * NOTE: it's still useful to deal with infinite loops caused by faulty fixes etc
   * if there is no test, let user fill out a checklist
* fix graph theme + sync mode
   * better coloring schema, so we sync mode becomes a pleasant experience
   * consider: ALWAYS track `traceSelection` in graph, but don't necessarily reveal (if graph is visible)
* [dbux-practice] complete workflow design
   * bug spreadsheet
      * overall bug analysis
         * concepts, domain knowledge, difficulty
      * hints
* Object rendering:
   * visualize when value got ommitted/pruned
   * show actual string length, if pruned
   * make valueCollection prune/omit parameters easily configurable
* instrument `try` + `catch` blocks
   * test errors in `try/finally` -> find errors in `try` block?
   * also show some sort of error symbol when tracing `catch` block?
* some assignments (and possibly other expressions) are traced twice
   * e.g. `this.subscribers = []` (one `ExpressionValue`, one `ExpressionResult`)
* fix: `function` declarations are not tracked
   * store staticContextId by `function` object, so we can quickly jump to them and find all their references
* [dbux-project] fix: use correct package manager (npm vs. yarn) when working with libraries in `dbux-projects`
   * -> don't use yarn, unless absolutely necessary (to reduce dependencies for users)
* fix: strings are currently tracked -> disable tracking of strings
* fix: `traveValueLabels`
   * get callee name from instrumentation
* allow for mixed type objects for object tracking
   * in `express`, `application` object is also a function
   * for "objectified functions": allow inspecting object properties
   * Problem: How to determine what is an "objectified function"?
      * -> `for in` loop runs at least once?
* projects -> express
   * when mocha test timeout happens, we see:
      1. -> `Error: timeout of 2000ms exceeded`
      2. -> `[Dbux] (...) received init from client twice. Please restart application`
   * -> it seems to try to re-init after the error somehow.
      * Did it reconnect multiple times or restart the process after being killed off?
* fix callback tracking
   * partial solution: use data tracking for callbacks
      * TODO: also data-trace function at declaration
      * NOTE: Won't work as comprehensively at all
         * Cannot accurately track how callbacks were passed when executing them without it really; can only guess several possibilities
         * Known issues: 
            * identity-tracking functions breaks with wrapper functions, as well as `bind`, `call`, `apply` etc...
            * We cannot easily capture all possible calls using instrumentation, since some of that might happen in black-boxed modules
   * NOTE: longjohn et al patch all potential scheduler calls for this, see: https://github.com/tlrobinson/long-stack-traces/blob/master/lib/long-stack-traces.js#L89
* [dbux-projects]
   * support multiple tests per bug
      * e.g. https://github.com/BugsJS/express/releases/tag/Bug-10-test -> https://github.com/BugsJS/express/commit/690be5b929559ab4590f45cc031c5c2609dd0a0f
   * `eslint` sample bugs require setting a node version
      * NOTE: BugsJs uses `n` for that; see `myTest.py`
         * -> `n` is not natively supported on Windows (see https://github.com/tj/n/issues/511)
   * report error if `applyPatch` failed
   * only run webpack if not started yet: don't kill project-wide backgroundProcesses when starting bug of same project?
      * fix this by remembering per-bug backgroundProcesses, as well as per-project
         * -> only kill per-bug backgroundProcesses when changing bug, but not changing project
   * `nodeRequireArgs` in `dbux-projects/src/nodeUtil` only supports relative paths?
* projects -> jest
   * (if test not asynchronous) exits right away, not allowing dbux-runtime to send data
   * also swallows "exit check" console messages
   * see if we can use jest with `dbux-register`
      * currently we provide `dbux-babel-plugin` manually (via `.babelrc.js`), and set `--cache=false`

* fix: small trace odities
   * for optional call, don't trace as `CallExpression` but trace as `ExpressionResult` if there is no function
   * when selecting a traced "return", it says "no trace at cursor"
      * (same with almost any keywords for now)
   * `if else` considers `else` as a block, and inserts (potentially unwanted) code deco
* fix: setup `eslint` to use correct index of `webpack` multi config to allow for `src` alias
   * Problem: won't work since different projects would have an ambiguous definition of `src`
* fix: provide an easier way to use `ipynb` to analyze any application
* fix: function names
   * also: `displayName` is often too long for proper analysis in py/callGraph
      * -> do not add source code of function itself -> change to `cb#i of A.f` instead
* fix: `staticTraceId` must resemble AST ordering for error tracing to work correctly
   * `CallExpression.arguments` are out of order
      * e.g. in `findLongestWord/1for-bad1`
      * because:
         * -> 1. `BCE`
         * -> 2. let other visitors take care of arguments
         * -> 3. let other visitors take care of result
         * -> 4. wrap all uninstrumented arguments in `Exit`
   * examples of out-of-order static traces
      * `awaitVisitors`, `loopVisitors`
      * anything that is not build into the singular visitor tree
   * Sln: generate `orderId` for each ast node and map to `staticTraceId`
      * Add a new pass to generate `orderId` for each node before starting instrumentation
         * Need to store `orderId` by `context`
      * When tracing, also store `orderId` in `staticTrace`
      * When error observed, lookup `staticTrace` by `orderId`
         * Problem: data dependencies: need to lookup when adding traces
            * Sln: Initialize `static` data and pure indexes of `static` data first
   * Problem: conditions on branches cannot predict the branch which observes the errors
      * Sln: make sure to trace every branch anywhere
         * e.g. `if`, `ternary`, ... other?
* [error_handling]
   * more TODOs
      * handle `try` blocks
   * (README) How does it work?
      * mark possible `exitTraces`:
         1. any `ReturnStatement`
         1. the end of any function
      * Once a function has finished (we wrap all functions in `try`/`finally`), we insert a check:
         * If `context.lastTraceId` is in `exitTraces`, there was no error
         * else, `context.lastTraceId` caused an error
* fix: `throw` + `await` instrumentation
   * test: when error thrown, do we pop the correct resume and await contexts?
* [variable_tracking]
   * Nodes
      * any expressions: https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-types/src/validators/generated/index.js#L3446
* [loops]

      * `loopRepition`
         * `i`
         * `headerVars`
   * add `loopRepititionId` to all traces in loop
      * add `loopRepitition`:
         * before `init`, and after `condition` has evaluated to `true`?
   * in loop's `BlockStart`:
      * evaluate + store `headerVars` (all variables that have bindings in loop header)
* [testing]
   * add `dbux-cli` and `samples` to the `webpack` setup
   * finish setting up basic testing in `samples`
      * move a basic `server` implementation from `dbux-code` to `dbux-data`
      * then: let sample tests easily run their own server to operate on the data level
      * make sure the `test file` `launch.json` entry work withs `samples/__tests__`
* [loops]
   * fix `DoWhileLoop` :(
* [generators]
   * not done yet :(
   * possible Test projects
      * `mongoose`
         * The call graphs of the mongoose module have the most unique
   edges, which is caused by JavaScript generator functions.

* fix: `sourceHelper` must use original code, but exclude comments
* fix: `StaticTrace.staticContextId`
   * generally less accurate than `trace.context.staticContextId`
   * cannot work correctly with interruptable functions
   * -> repurpose as `realStaticContextId`?
* advanced instrumentation?
   * we could patch `babel-traverse` to support non-type-based visitors:
      1. [context.shouldVisit](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/a34424a8942ed7346894e5fd36dc1490d4e2190c/packages/babel-traverse/src/context.js#L25)
      2. [traverse.node](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-traverse/src/index.js#L59)
* [error_handling]
   * add error examples
   * make sure, data is sent, even if error occurs?
   * if error occured, expression result might not be available
      * show `TraceType.BeforeExpression`, if result is not available
* [promises] keep track of `schedulerTraceId`
* [params]
   * add trace/valueRef for `varAccess` of function `params`
      * Consider: replace `varAccess` with single traces for `params`?
* [BaseTreeViewNodeProvider]
   * long node lists
      * when there are many nodes, add "show first 10", "show last 10", "show 25 more" buttons, instead 
* [cursorTracesView]
   * [performance] allow `getTracesAt` to deal with long iterations; not loading them all at once
         * also applies to `dataView`
      * `iterateTracesFront`
      * `iterateTracesBack`
      * `getTraceCount`
* [cursorTracesView] + [traceSelection]
   * when jumping between traces, keep a history stack to allow us to go forth and back
      * forth/back buttons in `TraceDetailView`?
* [interactive_mode]
   * when clicking a value (and when in "online mode"), send command back to application to `console.log(inspect(value))`
* [dataView]
   * a more complete approach to understanding values in current context
   * properly serialize and send object data
      * consider using a native `structuredClone` implementation (or some of its hackarounds)

      * track everything?
         * NOTE: when `TrackEverything` is enabled, we can track callbacks 100% as well
            * (if their declarations were instrumented)
* [cli] allow to easily run multiple applications at once
   * (for proper multi-application testing)
   * be careful:
      * `__filename` + `__dirname` do not work w/ webpack when not targeting node
* [instrumentation] if we see a function call for which we have no context, find out where it goes
   * (i.e. dependency name or runtime-internal?)
      * -> then allow to easily add it to our config and re-run so we can get it next time
   * Currently: seems almost impossible
   * Option 1: [Access `[[FunctionLocation]]` programmatically](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41146373/access-function-location-programmatically)
      * https://github.com/rwjblue/get-function-location

      * not sure yet if its possible at all in the browser [[*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56066523/javascript-retrieve-file-and-line-location-of-function-during-runtime)]
   * Option 2: when using `webpack` et al, instrument all functions of all required `node_modules`?
      * PROBLEM: instrumenting source-mapped files requires source-map merging which can be iffy and bug-prone
   * Option 3: while debugging, integrate with debugger API to guide user to step into function, then retrospectively retrieve data from call-site
      * most straight-forward, but UX is worse
* [cli] proper cli
* [instrumentation] allow to easily instrument any referenced modules (not just our own code)
   * ... and optionally any of its references?
* add test setup to all libs




## TODO: async!
* fix: `await` instrumentation
   * `Await`: `resumeTraceId` is `TraceType.Resume`, but can also be `ReturnArgument` or `ThrowArgument`?
* fix: `CallExpression`, `Function`, `Await` have special interactions
   * they all might be children of other visitors
   * NOTE: currently all other visitors use `wrapExpression`
      * -> checks `isCallPath` and has special handling only for that
      * -> Problem: come up with comprehensive conflict resolution here
         * `CallExpression`: `traceReturnType` controlled if `return` or `throw`
         * `Function`: no wrapping for functions
   * split up `functionVisitor`
      * enter
         * child('body'): generate `pushTraceId`
      * exit
         * child('body'): generate `popTraceId` -> instrument
   * split up `awaitVisitor`
      * exit: 
         * child('argument'): generate `preTraceId` -> instrument `preAwait`
         * self: generate `resumeTraceId` -> instrument `await`
      ```js
      _dbux.postAwait(
      (await _dbux.wrapAwait(
         xArg,
         _contextId6 = _dbux.preAwait(10, 29)
      )), 
      _contextId6, 
      30
      );
      ```

## TODO: basic splicing
* trace object property assignment locations
* trace variable assignment locations














## TODO (nice-to-haves)
* fix source maps
   * when `dbux-code` reports an error, stack trace does not apply source maps
   * but launch trace file does not contain any obvious hints (files are resolved correctly etc)
* variable assignment with `CallExpression` RHS does not allow selecting LHS
* dbux-graph web components
   * map data (or some sort of `id`) to `componentId`
   * batch `postMessage` calls before sending out
   * write automatic `dbux-graph-client/scripts/pre-build` component-registry script
* in editor, when we select a range with the cursor, only select traces that are completely contained by that range (e.g. when selecting `g(x)` in `f(g(x));`, do not select `f`)
* add `Cancel` button to `projectsView`
   * NOTE: needs a basic event system to monitor all project + bug activity
   * -> don't show button when nothing running
   * while any bug is running...
      * need to cancel before being able to run another bug
      * "run" button of that bug becomes "cancel" button
* fix: we cannot currently easily add images to the `graph` from the `resource` folder
   * -> define a `customElement` (e.g. `img-local`) that wraps an `img` element
      * prepend the img's `src` attribute with `GraphWebView.resourcePath`
      * -> Concept: "web component" (see here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots)

* largely improve `value` storage + rendering:
   * make sure that `_getKeysErrorsByType` never contains `Object.prototype` itself
   * refactor value storing
      * go to `dbux-runtime` -> `valueCollection.js`
         * (NOTE: in plain objects + arrays, we currently allocate one `ValueRef` for each primitive)
         * -> instead, let `ValueRef` allocate a single array to store *all* it's primitives
         * -> use lazy initialization for that array: only when at least one primitive is discovered -> allocate the array
      * go to `dbux-data` -> `DataProvider.js` -> `class ValueCollection`
      * change `dataProviderUtil`'s value reader methods correspondingly
         * (NOTE: there is about 10 of them, starting with `getValueTrace`)
      * Testing?
         * in `runtime -> valueCollection.js`: make sure to set `Verbose = true`
         * use `memberExpressions1.js`
   * fix `ValueTDNode` to render individual object + array entries using the same heuristics as `traceValueString`

[Persistance]
* what to persist?
   * dbux-data
      * all applications' data: save to/load from memento
         * HINT: see `userCommands` -> `doExport`
      * `traceSelection` -> `traceId`
   * Graph
      * re-open GraphWebview if open
      * store state of all components by `componentId`
         * careful: some components have invisible state (state that is not in `this.state`), such as `HighlightManager`
         * -> for that, we might need a basic serialization system for components











## Possible future work
* [codeDeco]
   * capture *all* variables (e.g. outer-most `object` of `MemberExpression`) *after* expression has executed
      * Problem: multiple scopes -> multiple contexts
         * need to be able to access all variables of current stack
   * display variable values at end of line
      * (same as when Chrome is debugging?)
      * NOTE: result of `i++` is not what we want
      * trace strategies
         * VariableAssignment + VariableDeclaration
            * just capture rhs (already done; but need to associate result with variable)
      * idea: just record all variables after line, so rendering is less convoluted?
   * show `x {n_times_executed}` after line, but only if n is different from the previous line
      * show multiple, if there are different numbers for multiple traces of line?
* [project: SimpleExpressFullstackApp]
   * purpose: test multi-application (full-stack) code
* fix: vscode auto attach is not working?
* add `DataFilter`
   * when hiding graph nodes, actually change global `dbux-data` filter settings
   * in any view, as well as TextEditor decorations, only retrieve traces, collections, values etc. that match current filter conditions
* refactor `Toolbar` -> move all mode control to `GraphRender` component in `GraphDocument.controllers`
   * NOTE: access via `this.context.graphDocument.controllers.getComponent`
   * remove `this.traceMode` from `GraphDocument`
      * NOTE: don't add any properties directly to a component, unless you have a very good reason to
* configurable keyboard shortcuts for navigation buttons
   * for configurable keybindings, see:
      * https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.keybindings
* add files to `ApplicationsView`
   * list all files as children for each application
      * click:
         * if not open: open file -> then go to first trace in file
         * if open: just open (don't go to trace)
   * group all "previous runs" under a "(previous runs)" node
* configuration that allows user to make changes and keep the changes after restarting
   * https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.configuration
   * https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/configuration-sample

* [slow warning]
   * display a warning at the top of EditorWindow if it is very large and thus will slow things down (e.g. > x traces?)
      * potentially ask user for confirmation first? (remember decision until restart or config option override?)
* keyword `wordcloud`
   * prepare function to generate all keywords in all `staticContexts` and their `fileName`s (without ext) of a single run
      * multiply weight by how often they were called (use `contexts`, rather than `staticContexts`)
      * TODO: we would also want to use the folder name, but for that, we first have to add instrumentation that identifies the relative project path via `package.json`
   * add as "suggestions" to the `"filter by searchTerm"` `QuickInput`, sort by weight
   * (we will add that to webview later)
   * fine-grained keyword extraction, split names by:
      1. upper-case letters: `addElement` -> `add`, `element`
         * careful: `addUID` -> `add`, `uid`
      1. `.`: `a.b` -> `a`, `b`
      1. `_`: `some_func` -> `some`, `func`
      1. `ClassLoader.loadClass` -> (2x `class`, `loader`, `load`)
         * NOTE for later: `loader` + `load` can be identified as the same, using `stemitization`, `lemmatization`
            * https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/stemming-lemmatization-python
            * https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html
   * NOTE: is there some JS or python NLP packages to help with this?
* [SubGraph_Filtering]
   * add two new buttons (for filtering) to each `callGraphView` root node: include/exclude
   * when filter active:
      * only show those runs + contexts in `callGraphView`
      * only show those traceDecos
   * add a new "clear filters" button at the top of the `callGraphView`
   * add a new "only this trace" filter button to `callGraphView`
      * only runs that passed through this trace
* [UI]
   * add a new option `showHideIfEmpty` to `BaseTreeViewNode`:
      * if `true`: render new button in node that toggles the `hideIfEmpty` behavior
      * button icon:  (???) https://www.google.com/search?q=empty+icon&tbm=isch
* [applicationDisplayName]
   * find shortest unique part of 'entryPointPath' of all `selectedApplications`
      * update in `_notifyChanged`?

* [contextChildrenView]
   * treeview that shows partial `execution tree` in the context of the selected trace
   * Nodes:
      * all child `loop`s + `context`s of current context in order
      * add one node for current trace to show where it is between the other calls
      * group child `contexts` into a new intermediate node, if they all originate from the same `trace`
         * (e.g. `find`, `map`, `forEach`, `reduce` and many more)
* [configuration + settings]
   * automatically store `BaseTreeViewNodeProvider.idsCollapsibleState` so it won't reset when re-opening
* [UI]
   * add a button to `selectedTraceView`: clear currently selected trace
   * add a button to `selectedTraceView`: "Select trace by `traceId`"
      * NOTE: probably use QuickInput to ask user for id
      * used for debugging specific traces uses all available visualization tools
* [Performance]
   * Weird bug: when we run w/ debugger attached in extension-host VSCode window, code runs 20x slower
   * NOTE: Bug w/ latest VSCode only?
* [playback] add awesome keyboard controls~
   * when "in playback mode" use arrow keys (and maybe a few other keys) to jump around very quickly
   * can we do it like [`jumpy`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wmaurer.vscode-jumpy) ([source](https://github.com/krnik/vscode-jumpy))?
      * Type pseudo "event handler" - https://github.com/wmaurer/vscode-jumpy/blob/master/src/extension.ts#L130
   * Problem: `vscode` has some issue handling the `type` command and it's friends
      * [Stacking of type event handlers + onDidType event](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13441)
      * https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/65876
* [codeDeco] add an `BlurBackgroundMode` `Enum`
   * `BlurBackgroundMode.Application` - "gray out" all code that is not in any executed `context`
   * more future modes:
      * `CurrentStack` - gray out all code that is not on current `stack`
         * also need to modify `dbux-babel-plugin` to store `rootContextId`
   * more future work (not yet):
      * e.g. "gray out" with higher granularity; gray out everything except all traces that were executed
* serialize/deserialize all data, survive VSCode restart/reload


## Fancy ideas (Dev)
