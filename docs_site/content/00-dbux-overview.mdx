<!-- future-work:
  → re-write this as visual intro to Dbux
  → give a clearer picture of what it can do and which scenarios work and which won't
    → limitations
      → e.g. issues w/ react and performance
    → future work: list of all directly and indirectly tested/experimented packages -->

Dbux is an integrated debugging environment (IDbE) and omniscient debugger for JavaScript dynamic analysis. We hope to help developers (i) improve program comprehension and (ii) increase debugging efficiency. To that end, Dbux records an application's runtime data, visualizes it and makes it interactive.

The screenshot above demonstrates several of Dbux's features, including:

* Left: [omni-directional navigation, values, executions](./dbux-features/07-trace-details.mdx) and [data flow](./dbux-features/50-data-flow.mdx).
* Middle: [code decorations](./dbux-features/04-code-decorations.mdx) and [trace selection](./dbux-features/06-select-trace.mdx).
* Right: [asynchronous call graph](./dbux-features/20-acg.mdx).

## Video Introduction

To get a good first impression of Dbux, we recommend this video. It...:

* → explains why we need better Debuggers,
* → demonstrates all of Dbux's tools with plenty of examples,
* → is fully timestamped (if you are impatient, we recommend taking a quick glimpse by skipping around a bunch).

## Dbux Features

Once an application has executed with [Dbux enabled](./dbux-features/02-enable-dbux.mdx), a collection of analytical tools is available via the [Dbux VSCode Extension](./tools-and-configuration/01-dbux-code.mdx), including:

* Dbux's [global view](./dbux-features/08-global.mdx) lists third-party modules, files and console log events. Takes user to the relevant code in a single click.
  * NOTE: While this eliminates the need for most of "[print-based debugging](https://www.google.com/search?q=print-based+debugging&hl=en)", it does not replace use of [proper logging](https://www.google.com/search?q=logging+programming+best+practices).
* [Trace selection](./dbux-features/06-select-trace.mdx) and the [Trace Details view](./dbux-features/07-trace-details.mdx) allow overviewing and investigating all executions of any piece of code and their respective values.
* Instead of only a call stack, Dbux presents us with the entire [call graph](./dbux-features/10-call-graph.mdx).
  * A complete [asynchronous call stack](./dbux-features/10-call-graph.mdx#stack) is also available.
* Instead of using the traditional debugger as a "magnifying glass" to slowly crawl along the execution timeline, Dbux offers random-access [navigation](./dbux-features/07-trace-details.mdx#navigation), in both directions of the timeline.
* [Code decorations](./dbux-features/04-code-decorations.mdx) can make it a lot more obvious what code executed at all, and how.
* Executed files, functions and values [can be searched](./dbux-features/40-search.mdx) for/through (culls a lot of noise when compared to code-based search).
* [Data flow analysis](./dbux-features/50-data-flow.mdx) allows us to quickly trace the reads, writes and creation of a selected value. This can also take us to the place of creation of a value in a single click.

## Call to Action

Dbux has a bit of a learning curve. We recommend programming beginners to start with the [interactive tutorials](./dbux-practice/02-tutorial.md).

## Word of Caution: ALPHA Phase!

Dbux is currently still in ALPHA. While we have been testing it on many small <CodeLink path="samples" /> and <CodeLink path="dbux-projects/src/projects" >several real-world projects</CodeLink>, there is always a chance, that the next one does not exactly work the way it should.

If you run into any problems or otherwise would like to share your experiences with Dbux, please [let us know](https://discord.gg/8kR2a7h).




<!-- ### Debugging Known vs. Unknown Code

TODO -->



<!-- These days, I personally feel even when debugging without Dbux that I start by strategizing, rather than "going with my gut" and put together a priority queue of places to check, before taking the next step. -->


<!-- Debugging is a quintessential task in the day-to-day life of a software developer. Something went wrong, and it is our job to fix it. Sometimes it is something that we did, sometimes it is someone else in our team, and sometimes it is under-documented, malfunctioning behavior or a regression in a dependency. Sometimes the bug is hiding in code we have recently been working on, sometimes it is hiding in code that we have almost entirely forgotten, sometimes it is hidden in the depth of the `node_modules` folder. -->

<!-- While debugging can be tough, we can get a leg up if we have designed a decent software architecture and proper working knowledge of used technology, frameworks and libraries. But even then,  -->
