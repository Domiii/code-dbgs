1. [Install the Dbux VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Domi.dbux-code) from the VSCode Marketplace.
2. Select the Dbux Extension on the VS sidebar -> Click the "Start Dbux" button

<!-- :::note
Currently, the [Dbux VSCode Extension](./tools-and-configuration/01-dbux-code.mdx) is Dbux's only GUI implementation.

## System Requirements

:::caution
As of Jan. 2022, Dbux at least requires `node@16+` and `npm@8+`.

If you don't have the right Node version, [please read this](#node-version).
:::
<!-- 
The [Dbux VSCode Extension](./tools-and-configuration/01-dbux-code.mdx) requires several command line tools to be installed:

* It automatically tries to determine whether those tools are installed.
* If it is missing anything, it should warn you upon start-up.
* If nothing is missing, it leaves a positive message in the Dbux Output Channel. E.g.:

```
Dbux requires the following programs to be installed and available on your system in order to run smoothly. Please make sure, you have all of them installed.

✓  node
    found at "C:/PROGRAM FILES/VOLTA/NODE.EXE" (v16.13.1 satisfies 16)
✓  npm
    found at "C:/PROGRAM FILES/VOLTA/NPM.EXE"

SUCCESS! All system dependencies seem to be in order.
``` -->

When working through [Dbux Practice exercises](./dbux-practice/01-overview.mdx), more tools might be required for each project.

* As of Jan. 2022, it at least requires `git` to be installed.
* It automatically tries to determine whether required tools are installed.
* If it is missing anything, it should warn you upon starting a project or exercise.
* If nothing is missing, it leaves a positive message in the Dbux Output Channel. E.g.:

```
✓  node
    found at "C:/PROGRAM FILES/VOLTA/NODE.EXE" (v16.13.1 satisfies 16)
✓  npm
    found at "C:/PROGRAM FILES/VOLTA/NPM.EXE"
✓  git
    found at "C:/PROGRAM FILES/GIT/CMD/GIT.EXE"
```

<!-- ### System Tools on Windows

On Windows, `git` and `bash` might not be installed, or installed but not available as command-line tools on Windows.

The trick here is that you only need `git` for Windows to get both (`git` automatically installs `bash`). However, in order for `bash` and friends to be available to Dbux (and to all tools in general), you must make sure to select the "Add UNIX tools to path" option when installing:

* If you use `git`'s GUI installer, [select the "Add UNIX tools to path" option in the installer](https://www.google.com/search?q=git+add+unix+tools+to+path+windows&tbm=isch).
* [If you use `choco`](https://www.google.com/search?q=choco+windows+git), add the corresponding command-line parameter, i.e.:
  * `choco install git.install --params "/GitAndUnixToolsOnPath"` -->


## Fixing Your Node Version {#node-version}

This section explains methods and pitfalls related to changing your Node version.

It is only important if your node version does not fulfill Dbux's [requirements](#system-requirements).

### Changing Node Management Systems

If you don't have a preferred node version management system, we recommend using [Volta](https://volta.sh/) for managing your Node versions. Unlike `nvm` and `n`, it is cross-platform. It also allows to locally require specific node versions. This way, different projects on your computer can easily run at a different version of node without messing with each other.

:::caution Caution: Uninstall First
Note that when changing Node management systems, make sure to first uninstall all previously installed managers and versions of node.
:::

### Changing Node Versions

Even if you are not changing Node management systems: changing your system-wide Node version can still become a bit of a nightmare.

That is because when changing Node versions, **it might uninstall or forget all your globally installed node packages**. If you are using globally installed packages, please consult your current Node installer/manager on how they manage them, before taking the big step. If you change your Node installer/manager, then you will most definitely lose all globally installed packages.


:::caution Caution: Global Packages
This is a [PSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service_announcement): [Don't Install Node Packages Globally](https://www.google.com/search?q=dont+install+node+packages+globally&hl=en)!

Like [many others](https://www.google.com/search?q=dont+install+node+packages+globally&hl=en), we recommend to never install packages globally (even if the module authors recommend otherwise). Maintaining globally installed packages is always a lot more painful, because they might affect all projects on your system, and, unlike locally installed packages, they don't have proper dependency management which easily leads to dependency conflicts.

If you already have globally installed Node packages, Dbux won't be affected all too much. It just needs some careful attention when you want to move to a different Node version.
