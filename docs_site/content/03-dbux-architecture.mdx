<!-- As of 01/2022, Dbux consists of four applications and seven supplementary modules: -->

Dbux dynamic analysis has three stages: `instrument`, `runtime` and `post-processing`.
They are implemented in four applications and several library packages:

### Dbux "Applications"

* &#8203;<ToolLink name="dbux-babel-plugin" /> (when used with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) on a target application) instruments the application and injects <ToolLink name="dbux-runtime" />.
* &#8203;<ToolLink name="dbux-runtime" /> is responsible for recording and sending runtime data to the runtime server (via `socket-io`).
* &#8203;<ToolLink name="dbux-code">dbux-code</ToolLink> is a one-click-installable VSCode Extension. It hosts the run-time server to receive the data produced by `dbux-runtime`. When data is received it is post-processed with the help of the `@dbux/data` module before visualizing it. Data is processed and presented in real-time, meaning that applications can be debugged while they are still running.
* &#8203;<ToolLink name="dbux-cli" />, a convenience CLI tool, allows executing a Node application with Dbux enabled (using [@babel/register](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-register)).


### Dbux Library Packages

Several library packages are also part of the [Dbux Monorepo](https://github.com/Domiii/dbux):

* &#8203;<CodeLink path="dbux-graph-common" />, <CodeLink path="dbux-graph-client" /> and <CodeLink path="dbux-graph-host" /> are responsible for rendering and letting the user interact with the [Call Graph](./dbux-features/10-call-graph.mdx) webview.
* &#8203;<CodeLink path="dbux-data" /> Receives, pre-processes and manages all data sent by `@dbux/runtime`. It allows us to query and analyze JS runtime data on a higher level.
* &#8203;<CodeLink path="dbux-projects" /> is used by `dbux-code` as part of [Dbux Practice](./dbux-practice/01-overview.mdx) (but does not depend on `VSCode`). It allows users to clone, install and execute real-world projects, their bugs and practice exercises *with a single click*.
* &#8203;<CodeLink path="dbux-common" /> Collection of commonly used utilities shared among (more or less) all other modules.
* &#8203;<CodeLink path="dbux-common-node" /> Collection of commonly used utilities shared among (more or less) all node-only modules.
