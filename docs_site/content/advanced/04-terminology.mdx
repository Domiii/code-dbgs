## Trace

We use (i) the name `staticTrace` to represent a piece of code (e.g. `f(x)`), and (ii) the name `trace` to represent a recorded execution of that code; meaning that one `staticTrace` (piece of code) has 0 or more `traces` (executions).

:::info
In dynamic analysis research, the term `trace` usually refers to the entire runtime log and `event` refers to an individual "trace log entry". But since the term `event` is commonly used by JavaScript developers to refer to something else instead, we decided to, use `trace` to refer to "trace log entry" instead. This choice, despite being more confusing to researchers, likely alleviates confusion for most JavaScript developers.

## Context


* A `static context` can be a `function` declaration or a `Program` (`Program` is Babel's word for "JavaScript file").
* A `context` (sometimes also called `executionContext`) is any execution of such function or Program.
* In many ways, a `context` can also be considered a "stack frame", but it is not quite the same.
* On file contexts:
  * While functions can be executed many times, JavaScript files usually only execute once, that is the first time they are `require`'d or `import`'ed.
  * After that first time, their `exports` are cached, and returned to any following caller of `require` or `import`.
  * That is why you will only see a single trace in the file scope, even if you require them many times.
* TODO: explain `virtual` and `async` contexts
