# Code Decorations

import Img from '@src/components/Img';
import CodeLink from '@src/components/CodeLink';
import DarkLightImg from '@src/components/DarkLightImg';

After [executing an application with Dbux enabled](./02-enable-dbux.mdx), all executed code is decorated with <span className='color-red'>↳ ↱</span> <span className='color-gray'>↳</span> <span className='color-orange'>ƒ</span> etc.

* These decorations allow us to better understand which parts of the code actually executed, and covey some basic properties of how the code executed.
* You can toggle decorations via the `Dbux: Hide Decorations` and `Dbux: Show Decorations` commands:
  <Img screen src="toggle-deco.png" />


## Interpreting Decorations

* Example: <code>f()<span className="color-red">↱</span>;</code> - the function `f` was executed and recorded, and we can step into it.
* Example: <code>g()<span className="color-gray">↱</span>;</code> - the function `g` was executed but not recorded, and we cannot step into it. This means that `g` is a native function or [not recorded for other reasons](../guides/01-runtime-trace-filtering.mdx).
* All code decorations and their meanings are defined in <CodeLink path="dbux-code/src/codeDeco/traceDecoConfig.js" />.

## Examples

In this buggy code, we can see that line 6 never executed, just from the code decorations:

<Img screen src="code-deco1.png" />
