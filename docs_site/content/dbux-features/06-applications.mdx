# Application View

import Term from '@src/components/Term';
import Img from '@src/components/Img';
import DarkLightImg from '@src/components/DarkLightImg';

This view lists all recorded applications. Applications of the same entry point are grouped together:

<Img screen src="sample-applications-view.png" />

<br />
<br />

You can use this view in several ways:

* Use the <DarkLightImg src="nextTrace.svg" /> button to the right of an application to go to its entry point.
* Click an application to enable/disable it.
  * If an application is disabled (no checkmark), you cannot interact with it: its code is not augmented, its traces cannot be selected or searched, and it does not show up in the call graph.
  * NOTE: Activating multiple applications at once can be useful for full-stack debugging purposes.
    * When multiple applications are enabled at the same time, their <Term term="cgr">call graph roots</Term> are merged onto a single timeline, allowing their data to be inspected together.

:::caution
If your application does not show up here, you cannot analyze it. If that happens to you, please [refer to our FAQ](../90-faq.mdx#my-applications-dont-show-up).

:::tip
This view is not crucial for most analysis tasks. We recommend minimizing it when you don't need it.
