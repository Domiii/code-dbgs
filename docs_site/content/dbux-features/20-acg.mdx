## Examples

### Example1: sample program {#example1}

This example demonstrates the ACG of a sample program:

<Img screen src="dbux-all-async1.png" />

The ACG (right) renders the program <Term term="CGRs" /> and the [asynchronous event edges](#ae) that connect them. The vertical axis is time (pointing downwards) and the horizontal dimension is a new experimental measure of "virtual threads" or "degree of concurrency".

* Code: The red solid border around the `done()` call expression indicates that it is [selected](./06-select-trace.mdx).
* In the ACG, the `await Promise.all(...)` node is also selected (due to [follow mode](./10-call-graph.mdx#follow)), indicated by a yellow solid border.
  * &rarr; This means that `done()` is in the CGR of that corresponding asynchronous continuation (or "virtual/resume context"). 
  * &rarr; This also means that `done()`'s CGR executed after the awaited promise settled.
* The dashed (red) border around the nodes on the left (`f1`, `sleep1s`, `f2`) indicate that the selected node "[synchronizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_(computer_science))" against them.
  * &rarr; Those CGRs are part of a promise that scheduled earlier but had to finish before this root could start executing.
* Other observations:
  * `f2` will always follow `f1`, `g2` will always follow `g1` and `h2` follows `h1`.
  * The ACG also clearly shows that  `f`, `g` and `h` are executing concurrently.
  * &rarr; If someone wrote code requiring `h` to always finish after `f`, or `g` after `h`, there might be a [race condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) because there is no such order assured in the code. That is why the ACG renders the three functions on separate "virtual threads" (vertical columns), illustrating that concurrency.


### Example2: todomvc {#example2}

This example demonstrates the ACG of [todomvc (vanilla-es6)](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/vanilla-es6):

<!-- TODO: take todovmc pic again -->

<Img screen src="todomvc-sample-acg1.png" />

* In this example, `val` (aka [value mode](./10-call-graph.mdx#value)) is enabled.
  * This option renders the value of the first execution of the currently selected trace in each <Term term="CGR" />.
  * In the ACG, we can see the value of `selector` for each <Term term="CGR" />, allowing us to see where/when the corresponding event (of this particular event handler) for each selector were handled.
  * We can click into each individual node to get us to the relevant execution of that event handler.
* NOTE: Event handler invocations of the same event are rendered in the same column.

## Why do we need an ACG?

[Asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous) and its relatives, [parallel programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_programming) and [concurrent computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing), lead to much more complex execution pattern than their non-asynchronous, non-parallel, non-concurrent counterparts. In fact, asynchronous semantics are one of the most daunting aspects of JavaScript that software developers have to deal with on a day-to-day basis, making it <span className="cursor-help highlight-on-hover" title="This is a generic statement, so phrased for dramatic effect, not for accuracy.">feared by many, underestimated by the rest<sup>*</sup></span>.

With the ACG we hope to make asynchronous JavaScript a lot easier to understand and digest. It presents a clear picture of an application's asynchronous control flow, and makes many types of <Term term="race conditions" /> visually obvious. It can also help uncover lacking error propagation and a lot more. For example, if your application's ACG has many individual columns, but a low level of actual concurrency (things don't actually happen concurrently), it might indicate that you (i) forgot to `await` or otherwise chain or nest your promises, or maybe (ii) are suffering from legacy code involving asynchronous callbacks and potential callback hell, that would benefit from re-writing using modern explicit asynchronous semantics.

## How does the ACG work?

The Dbux introduction video features several examples of the Asynchronous Call Graph (ACG):

[![Video Introduction](https://img.youtube.com/vi/N9W6rhHMKbA/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/N9W6rhHMKbA?t=621)

The Asynchronous Call Graph (ACG) is the [call graph](./10-call-graph.mdx) in `Async` mode. You can see the ACG by opening the [call graph](./10-call-graph.mdx) and switching to `Async` mode (by clicking the `Sync` button in the [toolbar](./10-call-graph.mdx#toolbar)). The two call graph modes share many features, including the toolbar buttons, coloring and more, as explained [here](./10-call-graph.mdx#toolbar).

`Sync` mode allows inspecting children and children of children of file and function executions. However, it simply puts <Term term="call graph roots" /> on a single linear vertical timeline. The ACG, on the other hand, uncovers the hidden connections between those roots on multiple vertical timelines and connections rendered between them.
In other words, `Sync` mode is great for inspecting control flow **within** individual <Term term="call graph roots" />, while `Async` mode is great for inspecting control flow **between** them.
In many debugging scenarios, you probably want to toggle between the two modes, as you investigate the control flow of an application.
