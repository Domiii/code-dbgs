<!-- ## Run an Application with Dbux Enabled -->

Before you can [analyze](./01-using-dbux.mdx) an application, you must first execute it with Dbux enabled. This means, the application must be instrumented by [@dbux/babel-plugin](../tools-and-configuration/03-dbux-babel-plugin.mdx) and injected with the [@dbux/runtime](../tools-and-configuration/04-dbux-runtime.mdx).

These are the different ways for achieving that:

1. [The Run Button](./03-the-run-button.mdx) <DarkLightImg src='play.svg' /> allows you to easily run a simple Node application with Dbux enabled.
2. The [Dbux CLI](../tools-and-configuration/02-dbux-cli.mdx) provides the magic behind [The Run Button](./03-the-run-button.mdx). You can use it directly in order to run Node applications from a terminal or command-line window.
3. [Dbux Practice](../dbux-practice) allows the user to execute a curated list of real-world applications (some with real-world bugs) at the click of a single button.
4. In order to enable Dbux for frontend and other bundled applications, the developer needs to manually [integrate Dbux into the project's build pipeline](../guides/03-build-pipeline-integration.mdx).

Once running, an instrumented target application will try to record and send all runtime data to the [runtime server](../tools-and-configuration/01-dbux-code.mdx#runtime-server) where the developer can commence with [dynamic analysis](./01-using-dbux.mdx).
