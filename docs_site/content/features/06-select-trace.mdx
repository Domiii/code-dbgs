# Select Trace

import Img from '@src/components/Img';
import DarkLightImg from '@src/components/DarkLightImg';
import Term from '@src/components/Term';


You can investigate a trace record (short: <Term term="trace"></Term>) of executed code using the "Select Trace" <DarkLightImg src="crosshair_red.svg" /> button:

* Place the keyboard cursor on a piece of code that has executed.
  * You should see the red crosshair <DarkLightImg src="crosshair_red.svg" /> show up in two places: the top right of the editor window and in the [Trace Details View](./trace-details)[^1].
  * If there is no red crosshair, the selected code has not executed (or its execution has not been recorded).
  * NOTE: Most executed code is [decorated](./04-code-decorations.mdx) <span className='color-red'> ↳ ↱ </span><span className='color-gray'>↳</span> <span className='color-orange'>ƒ</span>.
  * Keywords like `if` and `return` cannot currently be selected, however their conditions/arguments can.
* Click the crosshair <DarkLightImg src="crosshair_red.svg" /> or use the `Dbux: Select Trace at Cursor` command to select.
* Use repeatedly to select surrounding traces (as shown in the gif above).

Once a <Term term="trace" /> is selected, the [Trace Details View](./trace-details) should offer a wide array of relevant information regarding the selected piece of code:

:::caution
A piece of code might have [executed multiple times](./trace-details#executions). Make sure you know which execution is selected before drawing conclusions.

[^1]: You might need to hover over the `Trace Details View` for buttons to show up. This is a [limitation of the VSCode Extension API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78829).
