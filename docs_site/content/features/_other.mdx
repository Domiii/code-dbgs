## Trace Details: Nearby Values

`Nearby Values` lists *all* traces of the current [context](https://github.com/Domiii/dbux/tree/master/#context) (function or file) that are expressions and whose value is not `undefined`.

You can select (jump to) any trace inside of this list by clicking on it.

We want to add some grouping to this feature. That is being worked on and tracked [here](https://github.com/Domiii/dbux/tree/master/dbux/issues/264).

**Recommendations**: `Nearby Values` is very useful to...

* understand which values were generated in what order.
* decipher complex one-liners (see screen grab below).
