This article explains how Dbux determines which files and lines of code to trace.

When [Dbux is enabled](../features/02-enable-dbux.mdx), it automatically records execution of all files that are not in `node_modules`[^1]. This can be configured. However, it is a balancing act to determine the optimal set of files to trace. Often times it is easiest to tell Dbux to just trace everything, but tracing *everything* can slow things down significantly.

:::tip
If you know that some packages do not contribute to your dynamic analysis, do not `whitelist` them or explicitly `blacklist` them. This can improve [performance](./02-performance.mdx), especially if they contain many lines of code or many <Term term="trace" /> event records.
:::

## Whitelists and Blacklists

Dbux currently offers several configuration options to tell Dbux which files to trace:

* `packageWhitelist` (`pw`)
* `packageBlacklist` (`pb`)
* `fileWhitelist` (`fw`)
* `fileBlacklist` (`fb`)

Some notes:

* Each one of these settings supports comma-separated lists of file or package names or regexes.
* All paths are normalized to use `/`, so don't use backslashes on Windows.
* Implementation of the filter is in <CodeLink path="dbux-common-node/src/filters/moduleFilter.js" />.
* -> `packageName` is determined via <CodeLink path="dbux-common-node/src/util/moduleUtil.js"><code>parsePackageName</code></CodeLink>
  * NOTE: `packageName` supports namespaces.
  * Examples of `packageName` detection for different module paths:
    * `my/app/node_modules/a` -> `a`
    * `my/app/node_modules/a/b/c.js` -> `a`
    * `my/app/node_modules/a/b/node_modules/c/d` -> `c`
    * `my/app/node_modules/@a/b/c.js` -> `@a/b`
    * etc.


### Run Button + @dbux/cli

When using [the Run Button](../features/03-the-run-button.mdx) and/or [@dbux/cli](../tools-and-configuration/02-dbux-cli.mdx), you can configure this via the `--pw`, `--pb`, `--fw` and `--fb` flags.

* Example: `npx dbux run --pw=.* --pb=lodash ./test.js`
  * -> Traces all libraries, but `lodash`.


### Babel Config

When [manually integrating Dbux into your build pipeline](./03-build-pipeline-integration.mdx), you generally want to make use of the `moduleFilter` API (<CodeLink path="dbux-babel-plugin/src/external" />) in your config file and manually adjust your global Babel `include` **or** `ignore` settings to make sure that you are tracing and recording the files that you want.

NOTE: The `moduleFilter` functions return `function` (not `string` or `RegExp`).


```js
const shouldInclude = require('@dbux/common-node/dist/filters/makeInclude').default;

// ...

const moduleFilterOptions = {
  packageWhitelist: 'interestingPackage1,@interesting/package2',
  // packageBlacklist: '',
  fileBlacklist: '.*bad_file1\.js,.*/unwanted_dir1/.*'
};

module.exports = {
  include: [
    shouldInclude(moduleFilterOptions)
  ]
};
```

<!-- module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      // ...
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        include: [
          shouldInclude(moduleFilterOptions)
        ],
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            plugins: [
              // other plugins, running **after** Dbux...
              '@dbux/babel-plugin'
              // other plugins, running **before** Dbux...
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}; -->


<!-- TODO(re-write this: build-time vs. run-time performance considerations etc.)

Also, tracing long-running loops or high-FPS code TODO(explain). That is why you want to fine-tune configuration as to what and how you want to trace.  -->

## /** dbux disable */ {#dbux-disable}

You can disable tracing of individual traces and/or expressions by adding a comment containing a line of `dbux disable`, (e.g. `/** dbux disable */`) in front of it.

E.g., in the following sample code, a long-running (but unimportant) loop will not get instrumented, thus largely improving [performance](./02-performance.mdx):

```js
f();
/* dbux disable */
for (const i = 0; i < 1e6; ++i) {
  // ...
}
g();
```
