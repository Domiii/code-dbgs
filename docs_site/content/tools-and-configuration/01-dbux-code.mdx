The Dbux VSCode Extension is available on the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Domi.dbux-code). It is currently the only GUI implementation for Dbux.

:::tip
This page goes into some lower level details while [the Dynamic Analysis manual](../dbux-features/) explains the GUI and all analysis features in detail.

## Runtime Server

Currently, the VSCode Extension is the only implementation of the <DarkLightImg src="antenna_green.svg" /><DarkLightImg src="antenna_red.svg" /> Dbux Runtime Server. If enabled, it receives data from [Dbux-enabled applications](../dbux-features/02-enable-dbux.mdx) running on `localhost`[^1]. Once a first batch of data is received, the application will show up in the [Application View](../dbux-features/applications).

The Runtime Server is turned off by default. It turns on automatically the first time you use [the Run Button](../dbux-features/03-the-run-button.mdx) or run a [Dbux Practice exercise](../dbux-practice/01-overview.mdx).

You can manually turn it on or off via "the Runtime Server button" at the top of [the Applications view](../dbux-features/05-applications.mdx)[^2]:

:::note
Since the Runtime Server port is currently hard-coded[^1], only one instance can be running per computer/VM/container. Trying to start another instance will fail with a corresponding "port in use" error message.

## Commands

import Commands from '../_partials/_dbux-code-commands.mdx';

Dbux offers a multitude of commands. If you have trouble, using the commands, please consult [the corresponding entry in our FAQ](../90-faq.mdx#how-to-use-commands).

:::tip
(Almost?) all buttons in the Dbux VSCode Extension have corresponding commands.

Also: You can bind commands to keys: [VSCode official documentation on key-binds](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).

[^1]: Dbux can currently only receive data on `localhost` via a hard-coded port. This is a [known limitation](../advanced/future-work) we intend to address in the near future.
[^2]: You might need to hover over the `Applications` view for buttons to show up. This is a [limitation of the VSCode Extension API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78829).
